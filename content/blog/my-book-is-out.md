I am pleased to say that my book is now public. It is not finished yet, but it is good enough to get started with it.

You can buy it from [here](https://leanpub.com/angularjsdirectives).

I hope I can get as much feedback as possible (https://github.com/angular-tips/deep-angular-issues) to make the book even better!

Thank you for being there.
