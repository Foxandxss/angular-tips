Hello my friends. Did you miss me?

Well, after one year and a half, I decided I want to write some articles here. I am not sure how much
I can write, but we will see.

One year ago, I joined the Angular documentation core team, so I decided to put all my documentation effort there, where I could reach more people.

While that is still true, there are some topics that are better covered in a blog like this, so why not? :)

Also, as you can see, I migrated my blog from octopress to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The migration was done by hand, 
so there could be some broken links, so please report them to me and I fix them.
