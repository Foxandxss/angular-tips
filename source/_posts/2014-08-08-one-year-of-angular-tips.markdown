On August 2013 I created this blog, and here we are one year later.

For this year, I expect to bring you more articles so we can learn a lot of new stuff. Also, we will probably see some Angular 2.0 stuff for this year, which is awesome.

In this year, we got 235.388 visits which is quite awesome, thank you all for that.

Back to the present, I have something to show here, but for that, you will have to wait :D. Also I have some good ideas for new articles (I am always open to new ideas too).

So, I want to thank you all for your endless support and feedback.
