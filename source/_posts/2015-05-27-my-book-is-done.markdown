For those who don't know it yet. I finished my book a couple of weeks ago.

I really enjoyed writing it and I think you will also like it.

It will teach you both how to create directives and how to test them.

If you have any issue or feedback, please go to https://github.com/angular-tips/deep-angular-issues

Thank you!
