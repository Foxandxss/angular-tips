Hello, I am Jesus Rodriguez and, like many of you, I am an Angular.js learner.

I want to share with you all the tips and tricks I am learning on my way to Angular.js mastery.

Keep in mind that I am not an Angular.js expert and English is not my first language so bear with me if you find errors. In fact, you can reach this blog on [github](https://github.com/Foxandxss/angular-tips) and you can make your own pull request to fix the problems you find.

Thanks!
