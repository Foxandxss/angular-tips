So we finished this unit test series. How do you feel? Are you going to try unit testing yourself?

I understand that testing can be daunting at first, but give it a try! You can always ask if you get stuck (on the IRC or SO).

There are much more stuff about testing but now that we done this series, I want to write separate articles on smaller subjects until I cover all I know about unit testing.

Cheers and try yourself!
